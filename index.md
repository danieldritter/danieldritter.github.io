I am an incoming Master's student in Oxford's MSc in Advanced Computer Science program.
I graduated in 2021 from Brown University, and double majored in computer science and political science.
My interests lie broadly and the intersection of politics and technology, and I'm particularly
interested in designing and incentivizing more equitable and fair systems in machine learning
and artificial intelligence.
