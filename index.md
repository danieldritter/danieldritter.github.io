I'm a Junior at Brown University, originally from Dallas, Texas, studying Computer Science and Political Science. Within Computer Science, I'm particularly interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and within Political Science, I'm specializing in International Relations. In my spare time, I help produce musical theater at Brown and play classical and jazz piano.
