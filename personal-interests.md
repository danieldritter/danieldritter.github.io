  <h2> Jazz and Classical Piano </h2>

  <!-- <img class="imbox" src="/assets/images/piano_pic.JPG" width="462" height="306" alt="Picture of me playing piano in a pit orchestra"> -->
  I've played classical piano for almost 12 years, and jazz piano for around 8. I played in small ensembles all throughout high school, and still take lessons and play in groups occasionally in college. You can hear a few examples of my playing below.

    <h2>Reinforcement and Deep Learning Algorithm Implementations</h2>
    <p>
    I've written implementations of a few common reinforcement learning algorithms in python, both for my own understanding and to have the code ready if it becomes useful for research in the future. I currently have implementations of both A2C and DQN. In the future, I'd like to add additional variations of those algorithms, e.g. PPO,
    Double DQN, Rainbow, etc. All the source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/danieldritter/RL_Implementations">here</a>.

    <h2>Models for Sequential Decision Making</h2>
    <p>
    Over the past year, I've been helping to build out the MSDM(models for sequential decision-making) library, which is being developed by Mark Ho and a
    few others at https://github.com/markkho/msdm. I have been adding multiagent functionality to the library, and have added in several multiagent environments
    and algorithms to the library. My contributions are listed in the commit history for the repository.
