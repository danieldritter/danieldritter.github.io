  <h2>Machine Learning Fellow at Kern Systems: June-August(2020)</h2>
  Kern Systems is a biotech company focused on using DNA as a storage medium. Currently, storing information in DNA form is quite expensive, and so the company was interested
  in using compression tools to make the data they have to store as small as possible. I was brought on to apply state of the art machine learning and AI compression methods
  to test data, and provided the company with several potential tools by the end of the summer to use for compressing data digitally before storing it in DNA form.

    <h2>Image Analysis Intern at Perspectum Diagnostics: June-August(2019)</h2>
    <p>
    Perspectum Diagnostics is a biotech company based in Oxford, England. They work primarily with medical images(MRI, CT, digitized biopsy) and apply technological
    solutions, often machine learning or deep learning based, to provide quantitative metrics and measurements of disease or disease-correlated quantities(e.g. iron levels
    in the liver). As an intern on the Image Analysis team, working partly at their office in San Francisco and partly at their Oxford office, I was helping develop methods for applying deep learning techniques to digital pathology slides. I reworked their previous method for segmenting nuclei in digital pathology images, allowing for a large improvement in cases of clustered or overlapping nuclei. I built that new method into a complete data processing pipeline, that would take in a raw pathology
    image and give back statistics on the estimated inflammation in the image. Using this pipeline, I processed over 200 biopsy cases for two different publications comparing automated pathology methods to hand-graded ones and calculated the relevant statistics for all those processed cases(primarily correlation scores between hand-graded and automated methods).

    <h2>Teaching Assistant/Head Teaching Assistant at Brown University: 2019-2021</h2>
    I was a teaching assistant for several different courses during my undergraduate. As a TA, my responsibilities included holding hours, creating and grading assignments,
    assisting with the development of lectures, answering questions online, and generally being a resource for students in the class. I was a TA for CS1470 (Deep Learning) and CS1420 (Machine Learning), and I was Head TA for CS0030 (Introduction to Computation for the Humanities and Social Sciences).
