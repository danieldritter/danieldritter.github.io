## About Me
I'm currently a master's student studying computer science at the University of Oxford. Previously, I studied computer science and political science at Brown University (class of 2021). I'm broadly interested in questions of interpretability and explainability in machine learning. This ranges from technical questions, such as how we generate different kinds of explanations, to more social scientific or public policy ones (how useful are different interpretability techniques in practice?, how do we incentivize the development of interpretable ML applications?, etc.). 
## Projects 
### Multiagent Planning via Partial Coordination in Markov Games
This project was my senior honors thesis, supervised by Michael Littman and Mark Ho, and focused on finding methods for scaling multiagent planning algorithms in markov games. Learning and planning algorithms in markov games tend to scale very poorly as you increase the number of agents in the game. To avoid this, we proposed a 'model game' framework, in which each agent has a simplified internal model of the environment, and computes a plan using that model. A pdf of my thesis can be found [here](/assets/pdfs/Thesis.pdf).
### DeepLTLf: Learning Finite Linear Temporal Logic Specifications with a Specialized Neural Operator
This project was focused on the problem of learning linear temporal logic formulae from example temporal traces. We devised a specialized neural network architecture to learn LTL operators that could scale well beyond previous SAT-based approaches and handle noisy data more robustly. A copy of the resulting paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04147).
